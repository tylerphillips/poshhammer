		in the wild mountains just outside music mecca asheville, 
		north carolina live a trio of teenage siblings (and a 
		drummer) with old soul and retro hair. from down, down 
		in a basement littered with guitars, amps, microphones, 
		and drums comes loud music for the ages. these teens 
		play origanal pop-rock based music. combining perfectly 
		crafted hooks and dance beats with the energy of rock 
		n' roll. start with the beatles, layer in some david bowie 
		and roxy music, and then add the cars or the killers. voila, 
		posh hammer's influences. but they make it all there own: 
		navied's lyrics and lead guitar work cobined with tasnim's 
		astonishing vocals, mixed with tiam's smooth bass-lines, 
		and held together by dano's powerful drumming, give posh 
		hammer it's own sound and vibe. derivative? of course. 
		unique? absolutley? fun? way too much...
		posh hammer has made a career in music their top priority; 
		even convincing their parents to homeschool them to give 
		them the time needed to seriously pursue their dreams. 
		they finished recording there debut album at echo mountain 
		recording studios in early 2014. writing their own music and 
		playing multiple instruments, this band is the real thing, the 
		kind of music we are missing in todays electronic world.

		<div class="title-band">NAVIED SETAYESH</div>
    	<div class="about-band">WELL, GO AHEAD AND ASK: WHERE DO THESE LYRICS COME FROM? 
HOW DO YOU LEARN TO WRITE SONGS ABOUT LOVE, LOSS, ANGST, AND YEARNING WHEN YOU'RE ONLY 16 YEARS OLD. IT'S A BIT ODD REALLY, BUT THERE THEY ARE, AND THEY ARE NOT JUST GOOD SONGS FOR A TEENAGER, THERE JUST GOOD SONGS - CAREFULLY COMPOSED WITH GREAT HOOKS, BEAUTIFUL MELODIES, AND CLEVER LYRICS. NAVIED WAS BORN FEBRUARY 15TH 1998 AND TOOK UP THE GUITAR IN 2009. HE HANDLES ALL THE LEAD GUITAR WORK IN POSH HAMMER AND SITES MICK RONSON, THE EDGE, AND GEORGE HARRISON AS HIS PRIMARY INFLUENCES. HE ALSO PLAYS MELLOTRON IN THE RECORDING STUDIO.</div>

		<div class="title-band">TIAM SETAYESH</div>
    	<div class="about-band">NOW THIS IS A POWERFUL LITTLE PACKAGE. LOT'S OF GIRLS PICK
UP GUITAR AND STUM A FEW CHORDS AND SING PRETTY SONGS. NOT THIS ONE, TIAM WANTED TO FEEL THE EARTH MOVE, AND SO SHE PLAYS BASS. SHE PLAYS IT WELL TOO, HOLDING DOWN DRIVING BASSLINES FOR EVERY SONG. BORN MAY 27TH 1999 TIAM IS 15 YEARS OLD. STANDING FOUR FOOT EIGHT HER BASS IS ALMOST AS TALL AS 
HER, HOWEVER, SHE DOES NOT LET THAT STOP HER.</div>

		<!-- <img src="images/tasnim.jpg" class="ind-photo tasnim"> -->
		<div class="title-band">TASNIM SETAYESH</div>
    	<div class="about-band">TASNIM IS THE OTHER TWIN, AND WITH HER SIGNATURE POOFY HAIR
AND GUTSY VOCALS SHE IS THE CENTER OF POSH HAMMER. THE VOICE IS, INFACT, THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICE ABOUT POSH HAMMER. WOW, YOU THINK, THAT WOMAN CAN SING. WELL, SORT OF. SING, DEFINITELY. WOMAN? GETTING THERE... SHE'S ONLY 15 YEARS OLD BORN MAY 27TH1999. THE SOUL, THE RANGE, AND THE POWER IN HER VOICE COME FROM SOMEWHERE, ALTHOUGH, WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHERE. TASNIM COMANDS THE STAGE AS THE "FRONT-MAN" OF POSH HAMMER. SHE ALSO PLAYS PIANO AND ROCKS AROUND A GUITAR, HOLDING DOWN RHYTHM COUNTERPARTS TO NAVIED'S LEADS.</div>

		<div class="title-band">DANO CRACHIOLLO</div>
    	<div class="about-band">DANO IS THE ONLY MEMBER OF POSH HAMMER TO NOT HAVE THE
LAST NAME SETAYESH. AS THE STORY GOES THE OTHER MEMBERS OF POSH HAMMER FOUND HIS BUISNESS CARD PINNED UP TO A BULLITIN BOARD AT A LOCAL MUSIC STORE. A FEW DAYS LATER HE HAD FILLED THE HOLE AS DRUMMER, AND BY THE END OF THE WEEK PLAYED HIS FIRST SHOW WITH THE BAND. DANO BRINGS ENERGY TO POSH HAMMER WITH HIS POWERFUL DRUMMING, AND HAS HELPED INFUSE ELEMENTS OF DISCO INTO POSH HAMMERS SLIK POP-ROCK SOUND. HE'S BEEN PLAYING WITH THE GROUP SINCE LATE 2013.</div>
