	<!-- <div>THE BAND</div>
	<div>
		in the wild mountains just outside music mecca asheville, 
		north carolina live a trio of teenage siblings (and a 
		drummer) with old soul and retro hair. from down, down 
		in a basement littered with guitars, amps, microphones, 
		and drums comes loud music for the ages. these teens 
		play origanal pop-rock based music. combining perfectly 
		crafted hooks and dance beats with the energy of rock 
		n' roll. start with the beatles, layer in some david bowie 
		and roxy music, and then add the cars or the killers. voila, 
		posh hammer's influences. but they make it all there own: 
		navied's lyrics and lead guitar work cobined with tasnim's 
		astonishing vocals, mixed with tiam's smooth bass-lines, 
		and held together by dano's powerful drumming, give posh 
		hammer it's own sound and vibe. derivative? of course. 
		unique? absolutley? fun? way too much...
		posh hammer has made a career in music their top priority; 
		even convincing their parents to homeschool them to give 
		them the time needed to seriously pursue their dreams. 
		they finished recording there debut album at echo mountain 
		recording studios in early 2014. writing their own music and 
		playing multiple instruments, this band is the real thing, the 
		kind of music we are missing in todays electronic world.
